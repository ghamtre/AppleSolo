# Old Apple Website
I cloned the old official Apple's website for the Odin Project's [Building with backgrounds and gradients](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients) Project.

Using only HTML and advanced technique in CSS for the styling.
